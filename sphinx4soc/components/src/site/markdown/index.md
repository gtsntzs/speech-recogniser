Components are special services which have the capability to store some amount of messages before they produce a result. For example, in order to estimate the deltas, it is needed at least two previous cepsta to be available. Therefore, a feature vector with deltas is produced only when two messages exist in the component.

Components currently provided:

  * [**sphinx4soc-windower**](sphinx4soc-windower/index.html)
  * [**sphinx4soc-deltafeature**](sphinx4soc-deltafeature/index.html)
  * [**sphinx4soc-microphone**](sphinx4soc-microphone/index.html)


New components can be generated using the [Archetype :: Component](http://gtsntzs.github.io/speech-recogniser/archetypes/archetype-component/index.html).
